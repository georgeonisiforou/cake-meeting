But what if that were to change? What if… for instance, the world were to get slightly warmer? Well, now there is reason to evolve.

Billions of puppets with poisoned minds permanently fixed on one unifying goal: to spread the infection to every last human alive by any means necessary. And there are no treatments for this. No preventatives, no cures. They don’t exist. It’s not even possible to make them. So if that happens? We lose.",
